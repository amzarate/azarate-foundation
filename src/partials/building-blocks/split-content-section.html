            <p class="content-section-block-copy">Most orphans are born outdoors to free-roaming cats. Often, they are picked up by caring individuals who do not know that the mother is right around the corner. Other times they may be truly orphaned because the mother has become lost, has died, or cannot provide care to the kittens. No one is better at caring for kittens than a mama cat, so if you find a kitten outside, wait 3-4 hours to ensure that the mother is truly gone before providing care. If no mother returns, it's time for you to step up.</p>
